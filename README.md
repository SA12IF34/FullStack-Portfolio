# My portfolio website
The project is built using django and django rest framework as the backend which serves the APIs of my other projects ([social media project](https://github.com/SA12IF34/social-media-frontend), [ecommerce project](https://github.com/SA12IF34/ecommerce-frontend)).
And reactJS, nextJS, and vanillaJS for the frontend.
#
The project shows you how I write my code, and what libraries and frameworks I use.

You can take a look at the tests written in the project, and running them in case you cloned the repo by using the following commands.
```
# for all tests in the project
python manage.py test 
```
```
# for all tests in one app
python manage.py test <app-name>
```
```
# for tests inside of one test file
python manage.py test <app-name> test_<name>.py
```
